# TripCrate

Student-curated travel guides, discounts, and plans for nearby getaways.

TripCrate is a niche travel platform built for students. We focus on real, tested, and budget-friendly trip guides curated by students who actually visited the places. Start with campuses in Punjab and expand via our Charter program where contributors can submit verified guides and earn from bookings.

## What’s inside

- Student-first trip guides (itineraries, food, stay, transport)
- University onboarding (see nearest getaways first)
- Verified discounts for students (hotels, cottages, rentals)
- Transport options (bus, bike, car) with partner integrations
- UGC Charter: submit guides, get featured, and earn a share of bookings

## Landing Page Copy

Below is the landing page copy used in the project. Tone: witty, student-first, polite-sarcastic.

1. Hero Section
Headline:
College Wallet Empty? Trips Don’t Have To Be.
Subheadline:
Yeah, exams suck. But ditching Punjab for Manali on a bus-ticket budget? That’s… actually doable.
Pick your uni, skip the fake influencer reels, and get real plans: hotels, bikes, food, discounts — all curated by students who’ve actually been there.
No gatekeeping. No ₹5,000 “budget” trips. Just truth.
CTA Button:
Start From Your Campus

2. The Problem (We Get It)
Headline:
Travel Sites Are Lying to You.
Copy:
“Weekend in Goa for ₹2,000!”
Reality: ₹8,000 + “hidden fees” + hostel that smells like regret.
Meanwhile, you’re eating Maggi for the 47th day.
We’re not here to sell dreams. We’re here to sell doable trips. Because someone has to.

3. The Solution (It’s Us)
Headline:
Student-Curated. Student-Approved. Student-Survivable.
Copy:
Every guide is written by a real student who:

Took the 3 a.m. bus
Bargained with the dhaba uncle
Found a cottage for ₹800/night
Lived to post the reel

No corporate fluff. No “luxury on a budget” nonsense. Just: “Here’s what actually works.”

4. Features (The Good Stuff)
Headline:
What You Actually Need (Not What Influencers Sell)

Feature | Why It’s Not Bullsh*t
---|---
Uni-Onboarding | Type “WPU” → see Manali first. Not Kerala. Logic.
Real Discounts | 15% off cottages, ₹200 meals — we begged, you save.
Transport Options | Bus (₹500), Bike (₹1,000), Car (split 4 ways) — pick your vibe.
Curated Itineraries | “2 Days in Mandi on ₹3,000” — tested, not theorized.
UGC Charter | Visit, document, submit → earn 20% of bookings. Yes, you get paid.

5. How It Works (3 Steps, No Essay)
Headline:
Plan a Trip in 60 Seconds (Faster Than Your Prof’s Lecture)

Pick Your College → We know where you are.
Choose Your Vibe → Weekend? Solo? Squad?
Book or Wing It → Links, codes, maps — done.

6. Student Voices (Real, Not Paid)
Headline:
Don’t Trust Us. Trust Them.

“Found a ₹600 stay in McLeod Ganj. Thought it was a scam. It wasn’t.”
— Rohan, WPU CSE

“Rented a bike for ₹900. Rode to Triund. Came back alive. 10/10.”
— Simran, LPU BBA

“Finally, a site that doesn’t treat students like walking ATMs.”
— Anonymous (but grateful)

7. Join the Charter (Get Paid to Travel)
Headline:
Visit. Document. Earn. Repeat.
Copy:
You’re going to Tamil Nadu? Kerala? Shimla?
Take photos, write the truth, submit via form.
We verify → feature your guide → you get 20% of every booking.
Turn your trip into pocket money. Or at least, free biryani.
CTA Button:
Become a Charter Explorer

8. Final CTA + Footer
Headline:
Stop Scrolling. Start Going.
Copy:
Your next trip isn’t on Instagram. It’s one click away. And it won’t bankrupt you.
CTA Buttons:

I’m from WPU / LPU
I’m from Somewhere Else (Add My College)

Footer:
Made by students, for students.
No investors. No BS. Just trips.
